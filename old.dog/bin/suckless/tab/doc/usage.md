## Usage

Type a command with arguments separrated by semicolons, then press enter.

Commands are shortcuts for websites; enter a command by itself to go to the
corresponding website or add arguments to quickly traverse the site. There also are
a few builtin commands for configuration/personalization.

If no command is specified, the default command will execute. The default,
default command is Google (use the [`set`](commands.md#set) command to change this, e.g. `set;defaultCommand;dg` for DuckDuckGo).

You can also paste or enter a link.

## Examples

 - `y;cats` Search YouTube for 'cats'

 - `r;dadjokes;top;month` See the best dadjokes of this month

 - `example.com;n` Open example.com in a new tab
 
 - `set;clock;on` Display a clock on the page
 
 - `link;ig;instagram.com` Create a shortcut (`ig`) to instagram.com

Leading and trailing spaces will be stripped, so `y ; cats`, `y;cats` and `y;
cats` will all do the same thing (search YouTube for "cats").
