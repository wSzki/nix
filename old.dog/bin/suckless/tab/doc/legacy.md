If you are coming from the older version of tab startpage, there are a couple
things to note:

  - Share one config between devices with a Gist. See the
    [`config`](commands.md#config) command for more.

  - The builtin commands are now much more robust. For example, the [Reddit
  command](commands.md#reddit) now works like this: `r;subreddit;sort;range`.

  - Your custom commands are now called [links](commands.md#link), and are
  migrated automatically on first visit to the new site.

  - Ability to change both background and font colors (see
  [`set`](commands.md#set) command).

  - Hide or show the clock with `set;clock;on|off`.
