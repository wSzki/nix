vswm - very stupid window manager
=================================

Probably the most stupid window manager every created, written over an ancient
relic of a library called Xlib -- a library so old that it preceeded the birth
of planet Earth itself.

- There are no workspaces.
- All windows are maximized.
- Windows can not be moved or resized.
- Windows can have outer gaps.
- Windows can have borders.
